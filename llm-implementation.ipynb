      "Therefore, based on the data presented in the context, 100% of students reported that the use of digital tools negatively impacted their academic performance.\n",
      "Answer: Based on the data context provided, we can observe several trends in how students' feelings about using digital tools for studying changed after COVID-19:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Shift in Preferred Digital Tools**: Before COVID-19, the student primarily used a mobile phone for studying, but after COVID-19, they switched to using a laptop. This shift may indicate a preference for more traditional devices or a need for more functionality, potentially due to the demands of distance learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Increase in Time Spent Using Digital Tools**: The student reported spending more time using digital tools for learning after COVID-19 compared to before. This increase from 1-3 hours to 3-6 hours may be a result of the transition to remote learning and the need to engage with digital tools more extensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stronger Affirmation of Digital Tool Usage**: The student's stance on always using digital tools for studying shifted from \"Agree\" before COVID-19 to \"Strongly Agree\" after COVID-19. This change suggests a heightened reliance or perceived benefit of digital tools in the student's learning process following the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistency in Concentration Levels**: Interestingly, despite the increased usage of laptops and longer study hours, the student's ability to concentrate and avoid distractions using digital tools remained consistent. The student strongly disagreed with the statement both before and after COVID-19, indicating a stable level of focus in their study environment.\n",

      "Answer: Based on the responses provided in the data context, we can observe a shift in students' perceptions and behaviors regarding the use of digital tools for studying before and after COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Change in Preferred Digital Tools**: Prior to the pandemic, the student indicated using a mobile phone for studying, whereas after COVID-19, they shifted to using a laptop. This change suggests a possible preference for a larger screen or more functionality provided by a laptop for online learning activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Increase in Study Time**: The student reported spending 1-3 hours using digital tools for learning before COVID-19, which increased to 3-6 hours after the pandemic. This significant increase in study time indicates a greater reliance on digital tools for educational purposes post-COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increased Agreement on Device Usage and Concentration**: The student transitioned from agreeing to strongly agreeing that they always use digital tools in studying, which may indicate a more positive attitude towards the benefits of digital tools in the learning process after experiencing remote learning due to COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistency in Bedtime and Wake-up Hours**: The student maintained a strong agreement on having fixed hours for bedtime and wake-up both before and after the pandemic, suggesting a consistent routine regardless of the changes in learning environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Uncertain Impact on Sleep**: The student expressed uncertainty regarding the effect of prolonged use of digital tools on sleeping habits both before and after COVID-19. This ambiguity may reflect the student\n",
      "Answer: To determine which academic year reported the highest mobile phone usage before COVID-19, and how this changed after COVID-19, we need to look at the responses from students across different academic years regarding their use of mobile phones as a digital tool for learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the data context provided, we do not have explicit information on the academic year of the student. However, we can infer that the student is a sophomore based on the Level/Year indicated as \"Second/Sophomore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before COVID-19, the student reported using \"Other\" digital tools for learning, indicating they did not primarily use a mobile phone for academic purposes. After COVID-19, the student shifted to primarily using a mobile phone for learning. This suggests a significant increase in mobile phone usage post-COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer the question more specifically about which academic year reported the highest mobile phone usage before COVID-19, we would need data from a larger sample size or multiple responses from students in different academic years. However, based on the data provided, the student in the Second/Sophomore year reported a noticeable shift towards using a mobile phone for learning after COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a broader context, it can be hypothesized that students across different academic years may have also increased their mobile phone usage for learning purposes after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the transition to online education and the need for more flexible and accessible digital tools.\n",
